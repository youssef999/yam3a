## 🔑 Required Action: Update Service Account Credentials

### Files to Update:
1. **`lib/core/noti/send_noti_controller.dart`** (Lines ~10 and ~18-30)
2. **`lib/core/noti/noti_service.dart`** (Lines ~30-50)

### Keys to Replace:
```dart
"project_id"            → Your Firebase project ID
"private_key_id"        → From Service Account JSON
"private_key"           → From Service Account JSON (keep \n)
"client_email"          → From Service Account JSON
"client_id"             → From Service Account JSON
"client_x509_cert_url"  → From Service Account JSON
```

## 🔄 Migration Overview

### Before (Legacy API - Deprecated):
```dart
static const String _serverKey = 'AIza...';
headers: { 'Authorization': 'key=$_serverKey' }
```

### After (HTTP v1 API - Current):
```dart
final accessToken = await _getAccessToken();  // OAuth2
headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer $accessToken' }
```

**Why Changed?**
- ✅ More secure (tokens expire and refresh)
- ✅ Recommended by Google
- ✅ Legacy API being deprecated
- ✅ Access to new FCM features

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Compile Errors
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter clean
flutter run
```

### Issue: "Invalid credentials"
- Check all keys copied exactly from JSON
- Verify no extra spaces or missing characters
- Ensure `\n` characters preserved in private_key

### Issue: "Project not found"
- Verify project_id matches your Firebase project
- Check project exists in Firebase Console

### Issue: Notification not received
- Check device token is valid
- Verify notification permissions granted
- Check device volume and notification settings
- See console logs for errors
